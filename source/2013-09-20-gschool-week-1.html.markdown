<h1>Week 2 Retrospective</h1>

<p>
  This week the gSchoolers were tasked with building a program using Ruby that allowed a CSV file listing names with corresponding contact informantion to be loaded and searched through by a user. Sounds straight forward enough, right?
</p>

<p>
  I'm a newbie to programming, and this was the first project that wasn't a tutorial spoon-feeding us code and explaining exactly what it was doing. I was up a creek without a paddle! Fortunately, I had a very patient partner who walked me through everything (thanks, Luke!!) but it was frustrating to simply not have the skills yet to contribute much to the process. I'll get there and I'm defititely enjoying diving into Ruby, but as of week #2 I'm still trying to get my mind wrapped around the basics. This assignment was tough.

<p>
  We started as early as we could get to Galvanize each day, and plodded along until about 8:00 every night when we both had to leave to take care of our commitments at home. I have no problem with long hours and I actually enjoy just slogging along to figure out how to do things, but I never felt like I had a bright enough lightbulb turn on in my head to be helpful for my partner.

<p>
  Overall, it was a hard week and a very tough project for someone who has never done this before I'm reeally looking forward to the coming weeks as more of the piece start falling into place for me and I am more able to make this stuff happen with less help! The [currently] brief moments of understanding are making all the effort and struggle well worth it.
